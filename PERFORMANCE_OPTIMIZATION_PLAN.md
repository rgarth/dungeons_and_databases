# Performance Optimization Plan

## Character Sheet Component Optimization

### Current Issues:
- 2309 lines of code in a single component
- Complex state management with 50+ state variables
- Multiple nested modals and complex render logic
- Performance bottlenecks from re-rendering large component trees

### Optimization Strategy:

#### 1. Break Down into Smaller Components
- **CharacterHeader**: Avatar, name, class info, level up button
- **CharacterStats**: Ability scores, modifiers, skills
- **CharacterCombat**: HP, AC, initiative, death saves
- **CharacterEquipment**: Weapons, armor, magical items
- **CharacterSpells**: Spell management, slots, preparation
- **CharacterInventory**: Items, gold, treasures
- **CharacterBackground**: Personality, traits, backstory

#### 2. Extract Custom Hooks
- `useCharacterCombat`: Combat-related calculations and state
- `useCharacterEquipment`: Equipment management logic
- `useCharacterSpells`: Spell management logic
- `useCharacterInventory`: Inventory management logic

#### 3. Optimize State Management
- Use React.memo for expensive calculations
- Implement proper dependency arrays for useCallback/useMemo
- Consider using useReducer for complex state logic

#### 4. Performance Improvements
- Lazy load modal components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Add proper loading states
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo

### Implementation Priority:
1. Extract CharacterHeader component
2. Extract CharacterStats component  
3. Extract CharacterCombat component
4. Extract custom hooks for state management
5. Optimize remaining components

### Benefits:
- Improved maintainability
- Better performance through reduced re-renders
- Easier testing of individual components
- Better code organization and readability
