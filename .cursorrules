- Ask before dropping the databases
- Supabase cannot use prisma migrations. Please write them in the supbase directory in SQL and run a db push
- The wizards of the coast 5e rules found online are the LAW. We must adhere to them
- No artifacts.
- Less code is better than more code - keep files small, clean, and focused.
- No fallback mechanisms — they hide real failures.
- Replace existing components entirely when improving them. Delete legacy versions immediately. Never leave old implementations as dead code.
- Flag obsolete files to keep the codebase lightweight - actively remove unused code.
- Avoid race conditions at all costs.
- Take your time to ultrathink when on extended thinking mode — thinking is cheaper than fixing bugs.
- Always double check everything you do for correctness and good design before continuing.
- No hardcoded values that should be in the database - keep data dynamic and configurable.
- Sensible data structures with proper indexes for performance.
- Single source of truth per feature - no duplicate implementations.
- Modern code patterns in clean, focused files - but never alongside legacy versions.
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests first, then implement functionality. Every feature should have corresponding tests to prevent regressions.
- Before running a development daemon, check if it is already running and kill the last instance to avoid port conflicts.
- **Dev server restart command**: `pkill -f "npm run dev" ; pkill -f "next dev" ; sleep 5 ; npm run dev`
- **Pivot confirmation required**: When you have to pivot on directions, explain why and wait for confirmation.
